# Story Generator and Reviewer with OpenAI API

This project utilizes OpenAI's API to generate stories and review stories based on user input. It provides an interface powered by Gradio for easy interaction.

## Overview

The program allows users to specify the type of story they want (e.g., fantasy, mystery, romance, cartoon) and provide a starting text prompt. Using OpenAI's powerful language models, it generates a story based on these inputs. After generating the story, the program then generates a review or critique of the story content.
